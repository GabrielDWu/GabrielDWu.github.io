preview: "<b>Abstract.</b> Automated theorem proving uses algorithms to search for mathematical proofs. This paper describes three original theorem provers that operate in a branch of logic that lacks the law of excluded middle (P ∨ ¬P), called intuitionistic propositional logic. One prover employs a randomized depth-first search (DFS) to construct a proof tree, another uses DFS with memoization, and the third uses a DFS in LJT sequent calculus"
