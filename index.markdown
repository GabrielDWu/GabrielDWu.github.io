Welcome to my blog! Unsure where to start?
- If you're interested in **math** or **theoretical CS**, check out [*this post*](bounded-random-walk) that explains four different ways to think about random walks. You might also like [*this post*](describability-paradox) that talks about a paradox with the Halting Problem.
- If you're into **competitive programming**, you might like [*this tutorial*](flipping-coins) of a tricky combinatorics problem and an algorithm that solves it. You can also check out the [*list of problems*](problemsetting) I've written for contests.
- If you like **philosophy**, [*here*](value-of-art) are my thoughts on the value of art, [*here*](box-problem) is a metaphysical thought experiment, and [*here*](prometheus-simulation) is my first and only attempt at writing sci-fi!
